# SFND 3D Object Tracking

Welcome to the final project of the camera course. By completing all the lessons, you now have a solid understanding of keypoint detectors, descriptors, and methods to match them between successive images. Also, you know how to detect objects in an image using the YOLO deep-learning framework. And finally, you know how to associate regions in a camera image with Lidar points in 3D space. Let's take a look at our program schematic to see what we already have accomplished and what's still missing.

In this final project, you will implement the missing parts in the schematic. To do this, you will complete four major tasks: 
1. First, you will develop a way to match 3D objects over time by using keypoint correspondences. 
2. Second, you will compute the TTC based on Lidar measurements. 
3. You will then proceed to do the same using the camera, which requires to first associate keypoint matches to regions of interest and then to compute the TTC based on those matches. 
4. And lastly, you will conduct various tests with the framework. Your goal is to identify the most suitable detector/descriptor combination for TTC estimation and also to search for problems that can lead to faulty measurements by the camera or Lidar sensor. In the last course of this Nanodegree, you will learn about the Kalman filter, which is a great way to combine the two independent TTC measurements into an improved version which is much more reliable than a single sensor alone can be. But before we think about such things, let us focus on your final project in the camera course. 

## FP.1: Match 3D Objects
Implement the method `matchBoundingBoxes`, which takes as input both the previous and the current data frames and provides as output the ids of the matched regions of interest (i.e. the boxID property)â€œ. Matches must be the ones with the highest number of keypoint correspondences.

First, we iterate through `Matches` vector to extract the bounding box ID that enclose the keypoints on the previous and current frame. A vector `final_result` is created t o store the previous frame bounding boxes ID with respect to the current frame bounding boxes ID.

At the end, we count the number of each bounding boxes ID in each `final_results`. The element that has most number of pair of previous and current frame is inserted to `bbBestMatches`.

## FP.2: Compute Lidar-based TTC
In this part of the final project, your task is to compute the time-to-collision for all matched 3D objects based on Lidar measurements alone. Please take a look at the "Lesson 3: Engineering a Collision Detection System" of this course to revisit the theory behind TTC estimation. Also, please implement the estimation in a way that makes it robust against outliers which might be way too close and thus lead to faulty estimates of the TTC. Please return your TCC to the main function at the end of computeTTCLidar.

The Lidar-based TTC is implemented by considering the minimum distance to the vehicle in front of the ego car. The code is shown below:
```
void computeTTCLidar(std::vector<LidarPoint> &lidarPointsPrev,
                     std::vector<LidarPoint> &lidarPointsCurr, double frameRate, double &TTC)
{
    const double dt = 1/frameRate;

    double average_x_prev = computeAverageLidarX(lidarPointsPrev);
    double average_x_curr = computeAverageLidarX(lidarPointsCurr);

    double min_x_curr = computeMinLidarX(lidarPointsCurr);

    TTC = (min_x_curr * dt) / (average_x_prev - average_x_curr);
}
```

## FP.3: Associate Keypoint Correspondences with Bounding Boxes
Before a TTC estimate can be computed in the next exercise, you need to find all keypoint matches that belong to each 3D object. You can do this by simply checking whether the corresponding keypoints are within the region of interest in the camera image. All matches which satisfy this condition should be added to a vector. The problem you will find is that there will be outliers among your matches. To eliminate those, I recommend that you compute a robust mean of all the euclidean distances between keypoint matches and then remove those that are too far away from the mean.

The task is solved by iterating through the `Matches` vector. Then we iterate through all the bounding boxes and inserting the enclosed keypoint to the corresponding bounding box. We also calculate the Euclidean distance between the previous and current keypoints to determine whether a particular keypoint is within an acceptable interval. The interval itself is decided by considering the standard deviation of all the Euclidean distances.

## FP.4: Compute Camera-based TTC
Once keypoint matches have been added to the bounding boxes, the next step is to compute the TTC estimate. As with Lidar, we already looked into this in the second lesson of this course, so you please revisit the respective section and use the code sample there as a starting point for this task here. Once you have your estimate of the TTC, please return it to the main function at the end of computeTTCCamera.

The task is solved by iterating through `Matches` vector and calculate the distance of the each current point. If the distance is greater than the minimum acceptable value, we get a distance ratio. Then, we calculate the mean and standard deviation to have a filtered distance ratio. At the end, a median value from the `filtered_dist_ratio` is used to calculate to TTC.
